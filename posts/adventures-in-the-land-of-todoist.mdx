Hey there nice to see you again. This blog is gonna be mainly be about Todoist and how I personally set it up

# Introduction

First of all what is todoist? "Todoist isÂ a **to-do list and task manager**. Combining tasks, projects, comments, attachments, notifications, and more. Todoist lets users streamline their personal and team productivity and work more effectively."

Of course there are many other apps for this sort of stuff but I ended up picking it due to its great UI/UX and awesome set of features. The most importortant being priorities, projects, labels and filtering.

# Labels

In essence all labels are is ways to sort tasks in any shape and form you want for me thats:

- places: @home, @school and @go(outside at the shop or whatever)
- time: @5m (5 minuted), @120m+ (120 minutes or more) and all the minutes in between to help me get a idea of how long a task will take

# Priority 

Priorities are insanely useful and you can put them on a task quickly by typing out p1, p2 or p3 and it really helps as it lets us know what's most important, I use them as follows:

- Priority 1: Must Do
- Priority 2: Should Do
- Priority 3: Could Do

# Filters 

I use Filters to figure out what I should do first and use them as follows with the query included:

- Immediately (Stuff I must do or there would be repercussions): **(overdue | today) & @p1**
- Quickly (Stuff I should do or there would be small repercussions): **(overdue | today) & p2**
- Intermediately (Stuff I could do but it's up to me: **(overdue | today) & p3**

# Projects

They're mostly just a way to sort stuff into aspects of life such as Personal and School which I do:

- Personal: For example cleaning my pc monitor
- School: For example finish physics assignment on Pressure In Liquids

# Conclusion

I hope you learnt something from this short blog and you were able to take some of my frankenstein setup and use it in some of your own.
