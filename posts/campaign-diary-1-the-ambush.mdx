# Preface
Now you should know I am quite the new DM in fact this is my first time ever playing DnD at all but thankfully I have done butt loads of research and watched quite a bit of [Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-YZvLUXcR8&list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_) by Matt Coville and watched [Part 1 Goblin Arrows (LMoP DM Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6REHfujsUlQ) by How to D&D. But even then take all my advice with scoops of salt.


# Session Summary
First thing I did was introduce my players to the adventure itself by using the [Lost Mine of Phandelver Introduction Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23pnS8FW9XM) by SFMJames which is very epic and useful. I then went on to establish the plot hook by introducing Gundren Rockseeker and how he had hired them to haul some items in a wagon to Phandalin but that he had to go ahead to "take care of some buisness" and he left with his escort. 

Now while they were sitting in the wagon is when I made them introduce their character and showed some portraits just in case. With that done it was now time for the goblin ambush, before this I had heard horror stories about TPKs here so I dialed back some of the difficulty and made only 2 of the goblins have shortbows and 1 have a club.

After going round the bend and noticing the dead horses they sent out the Rogue Ren to investigate which is when he got ambushed but thankfully his perception was high enough to notice them and not get surprised but his allies were still behind in the wagon and did get surprised so they would be out of commission for the first round. They all rolled initiative and the order was as follows:

- Blaine the Dragonborn Wizard
- Shen the Dragonborn Fighter
- Ren the Human Rogue
- Shortbow Goblin
- Shortbow Goblin
- Club **(The weapon not the place!)** Goblin

I do believe my biggest short coming was during combat when I was unable to engage one of the players my Dragonborn Fighter and let him do any damage of the sort due to him being so far behind and being melee although he did get to try and throw his Handaxe but he missed sadly but there was a even bigger booboo I commited.

*I fudged a roll* I know it doesn't seem bad on the surface but it was a really bad one. What happen was one of the Goblins got a crit on the Rogue from which if he took the damage rolled he would die (Although he would still have 3 death saving throws). Which I believe did 3 bad things:

1. It set the precedent that crits aren't as strong and don't matter as much as they really do which will probably take away the fear when a enemy rolls a crit and the excitement that comes with you rolling a crit. Hopefully this can be mitigated later on when we see another critical roll show up.
2. I think it also made them think goblins aren't as strong as they really since they managed to beat the encounter only using 2 players whic is especially amplified since all of them are gamers which usually contain goblins who are extremely weak I'll probably explain this to them next time.
3. Prevented the Dragonborn Fighter from getting any actions as the Rogue killed one of the Goblins due to being let to live and the Wizard slept on of them and killed the other using his spells and his sheer range

# Conclusion
I believe I still have a lot to learn as being a DM especially to not let everything go well for the players which might lead to boredom and a overall worse campaign with less good moments. But I still have lots of time to do that thankfully and I hope I can run my next session better.
